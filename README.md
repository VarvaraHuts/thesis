Machine translation of German compounds into Russian.


This project was dedicated to automatic identification of translation types of German compounds in Russian.

We tried to define automatically one of three possible translation types:
- adjective + noun ('Nachthimmel' - 'ночное небо')
- noun + noun in genitive case ('Busfahrer' - 'водитель автобуса')
- noun ('Apfelbaum' - 'яблоня')

The automatic identification of translation types was based on different structural/grammatical/semantic features of compounds.
